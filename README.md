# Early-Sepsis-Detection-through-Clinical-Data-Analysis
In the United States, sepsis affects at least 1.7 million adults annually and is the leading cause of death in hospitals, contributing to about 350,000 deaths each year. It is an extreme, life-threatening response to an infection that can cause organ damage and death, with the risk of death increasing the longer it goes untreated. Common signs include fever or low temperature, confusion, difficulty breathing, clammy skin, and a high heart rate. Prompt detection and treatment are therefore essential to improving outcomes and minimizing the devastating impact of sepsis.

## Objective
To promtly detect a patient’s risk of developing sepsis and generate hourly sepsis predictions based on their clinical records.

## About Clinical Data 
This dataset comprises over 1.5 million clinical data points from more than 40,000 ICU patients, aimed at detecting early sepsis.

Using SQL, Excel, and Tableau, I performed:

## Demographic Analysis: 
Patient profiling to identify high-risk groups and trends in sepsis incidence. I leveraged Level of Detail (LOD) expressions and calculated fields in Tableau to classify patients into sepsis, non-sepsis, and onset groups.

## Biomarker & Vital Sign Analysis: 
Monitored 34 key biomarkers and vital signs to detect early warning signals of sepsis.

## Sepsis Stage Analysis: 
Evaluated SIRS criteria and septic shock progression to track disease severity and support timely interventions.

These analyses generated actionable insights, improving ICU efficiency, enabling prompt intervention, and supporting better patient outcomes.
